* [App.json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/app.json) - Deploy config to Heroku through deploy button;
* [Wallaby.j](http://wallabyjs.com/) - Live [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) test runner plug-in;
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - Test runner;
* [Telegraf.js](http://telegraf.js.org/) - Library that handles it the Telegram connection;
* [Telegraf-i18n](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf-i18n) - Library that handles language integration;
* [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) - Library that handles it the date and time formating;
* [i18n-yaml](https://github.com/martinheidegger/i18n-node-yaml) - Since Telegraf-i18n only handles Telegraf context, there's a need to parse other kinds of context;
* [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) - Library that imports environment variables;
* [tinyurl](https://github.com/AlphaT3ch/TinyURL) - Library that handles it the URL shorten requests;
* [remove-accents](https://github.com/tyxla/remove-accents) - Some international content has accents and this library removes it -- makes de search more easy to perform given that even if the podcast name has accents not necessary it will be marked as having those in the iTunes store;
* [itunes-search](https://github.com/connor/itunes-node) - One of many libraries that does the fetching from iTunes API, but this one is the only one that does it right.
